**_Local Search Heuristics and Meta Heuristics_** by Mehmet Akif Çördük 

**Abstract:** Combinatorial optimization problems are NP-hard problems with very large search space. It is impractical to solve instances with exact methods. Heuristics and meta-heuristics are helpful to explore the search space efficiently and find good local minimums. In this talk, we will be exploring local search heuristics and meta heuristics with a focus on vehicle routing algorithms. We will also talk about parallelization strategies and show possible implementations on Cuda architecture.

**Bio:** Akif is an alumni of Boğaziçi University. He is part of the Developer Technology Engineering team of NVIDIA Europe, Middle East, and Africa. Previously, he wrote his master's thesis on GPU-based pricing engines, and later continued working on the same topic. Akif has a background in computer engineering and software engineering. He's interested in parallel algorithms, GPU performance optimization, and combinatorial optimization.

**_Behavioral Biometrics for User Authentication and Identification_** by Sümeyye Ağaç

**Abstract:** Nowadays, mobile and wearable devices and technologies have become a part of our daily lives because of their commoditization and comfort. Traditional user authentication systems use passwords or PINs to protect user-sensitive data and provide a personalized user experience in several services (e.g., personal emails, banks, and social networking accounts) in such devices. For security reasons, these passwords must be unique for each service, and each password must be long enough and composed of different character types, making it difficult to remember. With the help of biometrics (biological metrics), we move from "something the user knows" to "something the user is". In this talk, we will discuss how systems can recognize their users based on the unique characteristics of them rather than relying on their knowledges. More precisely, we will concentrate on authentication and identification using behavioral biometrics (e.g., gait, keystroke dynamics), how they are used, their advantages and disadvantages, and, finally, give future directions on this topic.

**Bio:** Sümeyye Ağaç received her BS and MS degrees in Computer Engineering from Galatasaray University, Turkey, in 2016 and 2019, respectively. Currently, she is a Ph.D. student in Computer Engineering department of Boğaziçi University in Turkey.

**_Federated Learning and Applications_** by Cihat Keçeci

**Abstract:**  Increasing amount of distributed and private data enables the training of sophisticated machine learning models. Conventional machine learning models generally need a centralized dataset for training the model. However, the data may be distributed among different users, and it may not be possible to collect the dataset into a centralized machine due to privacy or other requirements. Federated Learning enables distributed training of machine learning models by sharing only the model parameters through a central server while keeping the client data private. In this talk, we will provide an introduction to Federated Learning by examining the common problems in the Federated Learning scenarios with the proposed solutions.

**Bio:** Cihat Keçeci received his B.S. (Hons.) and M.S. degrees in electrical and electronics engineering from Boğaziçi University, İstanbul, Turkey. He was with the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey TÜBİTAK, Informatics and Information Security Research Center (BİLGEM). He is currently pursuing his Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering with Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA. His research interests include machine learning, smart grids, and wireless communications.

**_The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Computational Genomics_** by Hakime Öztürk

**Abstract:** Technological advances in genomics have led to a rapid growth of biological data from large numbers of samples. The application of modern machine learning methods, such as deep learning, allows utilizing these very large data sets to find hidden structure within them and to make accurate predictions. In this talk, we first provide a background on various genomics research questions and then discuss some of the current research papers on the application of deep learning methodologies that aim to address these. 

**Bio:** Hakime Öztürk is currently a post-doctoral researcher at German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ).  She received her Ph.D. in Computer Engineering from Boğaziçi University in 2019. Her research interests include application of machine learning methodologies to biological problems.

**_Metamorphic Relations via Relaxations: An Approach to Obtain Oracles for Action-Policy Testing_** by Hasan Ferit Enişer

**Abstract:** Testing is a promising way to gain trust in a learned action policy, in particular if the policy is a neural network. A ''bug'' in this context constitutes undesirable or fatal policy behavior, for example, satisfying a failure condition. But how do we distinguish whether such behavior is due to bad policy decisions, or whether it is actually unavoidable under the given circumstances? This requires knowledge about optimal solutions, which defeats the scalability of testing. Related problems occur in software testing when the correct program output is not known.  Metamorphic testing addresses this issue through metamorphic relations, specifying how a given change to the input should affect the output, thus providing an oracle for the correct output. Yet, how do we obtain such metamorphic relations for action policies?  Here, we show that the well explored concept of relaxations in the Artificial Intelligence community can serve this purpose. We also design fuzzing strategies for test-case generation. In experiments on three single-agent games, our technology is able to effectively identify true bugs, i.e., avoidable failures of the policy under test, which has not been possible until now.

**Bio:** I am a third year Ph.D. student at MPI-SWS in Germany. Broadly, I work in the intersection of software testing/verification and artificial intelligence. I develop testing and verification techniques to ensure the dependability of AI-enabled systems. I am advised by Dr. Maria Christakis and work in the "Practical Formal Methods" group at MPI-SWS. I graduated from Boğaziçi University in 2017 with a M.Sc. in computer science. Before that, I did my B.Sc. studies in computer science at the same university.

**_Multiplicity in the Partitioning of Signed Graphs_** by Nejat Arınık

**Abstract:** According to the structural balance theory, a signed graph is considered structurally balanced when it can be partitioned into a number of modules such that positive edges are located inside the modules and negatives ones are in-between them. In practice, real-world networks are rarely perfectly balanced. When it is not the case, one wants to measure the magnitude of the imbalance and to identify the set of edges related to the network imbalance. The Correlation Clustering (CC) problem is precisely defined as finding the partition with minimal imbalance.

Signed graph partitioning is an important task, which has many applications, as finding a balanced partition helps understanding the system modeled by the graph. However, the standard approach used in the literature is to find a single partition and focus the rest of the analysis on it, as if it was sufficient to fully characterize the studied system. Yet, it may not reflect the meso-structure of the network, and one may need to seek for other partitions to build a better picture. Although this need to look for multiplicity is extremely important from the end user's perspective, only a very few works took it into consideration in their analysis, up to now.

One particular situation, where we want to relax this traditional single-partition assumption to allow searching for multiple partitions, arises in the context of the CC problem. When solving an instance of such problem, several or even many optimal partitions may coexist. If multiple optimal partitions coexist, one can then wonder how different/diverse they are. Put differently, we want to know what we loose when considering only one partition, while there might be multiple ones. In order to answer these questions, one should ideally enumerate completely the space of optimal partitions, and perform its analysis. To this end, we propose a new efficient solution space enumeration method and a cluster analysis-based framework in order to first enumerate the space of optimal partitions and then empirically study such space. Based on our empirical study, our main finding is the identification of 4 different situations: 1) unique solution; 2) single class of similar solutions; 3) several classes of similar solutions; 4) multiple solutions without a clear clustering structure.

**_Topic Modeling: Clustering with Labels_** by Burak Suyunu

**Abstract:** Topic models are often used to organize and interpret large and unstructured corpora of text documents. They try to explain the topics that constitute the semantic infrastructure of the document sets and try to find the distributions of these topics for the documents. Because of its unsupervised nature, the outputs of a topic model has to be interpretable to represent its success. However, the results of a topic model are usually weakly correlated with human interpretation. 

In this talk, we will first provide a background on how topic models work and explain traditional topic modeling approaches such as NMF, LSA and LDA. Then we will present a semisupervised topic model called Theme Supervised Nonnegative Matrix Factorization that can benefit from labeled documents to improve and facilitate the interpretation of the topics. We will finish the talk with the recent topic models such as BERTopic and Top2Vec that utilizes word embeddings, language models, dimensionality reduction and clustering techiques.

**Bio:** Burak Suyunu received his B.S. and M.S. degrees in computer engineering from Boğaziçi University. Currently while pursuing his Ph.D. in computer engineering, he works as a teaching assistant in Boğaziçi University. His research interests include bioinformatics, NLP and machine learning.
