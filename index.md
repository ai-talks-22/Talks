**__Local search heuristics and meta heuristics__** by Mehmet Akif Çördük 

**Abstract:** Combinatorial optimization problems are NP-hard problems with very large search space. It is impractical to solve instances with exact methods. Heuristics and meta-heuristics are helpful to explore the search space efficiently and find good local minimums. In this talk, we will be exploring local search heuristics and meta heuristics with a focus on vehicle routing algorithms. We will also talk about parallelization strategies and show possible implementations on Cuda architecture.

**Bio:** Akif is an alumni of Bogazici University. He is part of the Developer Technology Engineering team of NVIDIA Europe, Middle East, and Africa. Previously, he wrote his master's thesis on GPU-based pricing engines, and later continued working on the same topic. Akif has a background in computer engineering and software engineering. He's interested in parallel algorithms, GPU performance optimization, and combinatorial optimization.
