**_Local search heuristics and meta heuristics_** by Mehmet Akif Çördük 

**Abstract:** Combinatorial optimization problems are NP-hard problems with very large search space. It is impractical to solve instances with exact methods. Heuristics and meta-heuristics are helpful to explore the search space efficiently and find good local minimums. In this talk, we will be exploring local search heuristics and meta heuristics with a focus on vehicle routing algorithms. We will also talk about parallelization strategies and show possible implementations on Cuda architecture.

**Bio:** Akif is an alumni of Boğaziçi University. He is part of the Developer Technology Engineering team of NVIDIA Europe, Middle East, and Africa. Previously, he wrote his master's thesis on GPU-based pricing engines, and later continued working on the same topic. Akif has a background in computer engineering and software engineering. He's interested in parallel algorithms, GPU performance optimization, and combinatorial optimization.

**_Behavioral Biometrics for User Authentication and Identification_** by Sümeyye Ağaç

**Abstract:** Nowadays, mobile and wearable devices and technologies have become a part of our daily lives because of their commoditization and comfort. Traditional user authentication systems use passwords or PINs to protect user-sensitive data and provide a personalized user experience in several services (e.g., personal emails, banks, and social networking accounts) in such devices. For security reasons, these passwords must be unique for each service, and each password must be long enough and composed of different character types, making it difficult to remember. With the help of biometrics (biological metrics), we move from "something the user knows" to "something the user is". In this talk, we will discuss how systems can recognize their users based on the unique characteristics of them rather than relying on their knowledges. More precisely, we will concentrate on authentication and identification using behavioral biometrics (e.g., gait, keystroke dynamics), how they are used, their advantages and disadvantages, and, finally, give future directions on this topic.

**Bio:** Sümeyye Ağaç received her BS and MS degrees in Computer Engineering from Galatasaray University, Turkey, in 2016 and 2019, respectively. Currently, she is a Ph.D. student in Computer Engineering department of Boğaziçi University in Turkey. Her current research interests are human activity recognition, wearable computing and user authentication.
