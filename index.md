**_Local search heuristics and meta heuristics_** by Mehmet Akif Çördük 

**Abstract:** Combinatorial optimization problems are NP-hard problems with very large search space. It is impractical to solve instances with exact methods. Heuristics and meta-heuristics are helpful to explore the search space efficiently and find good local minimums. In this talk, we will be exploring local search heuristics and meta heuristics with a focus on vehicle routing algorithms. We will also talk about parallelization strategies and show possible implementations on Cuda architecture.

**Bio:** Akif is an alumni of Boğaziçi University. He is part of the Developer Technology Engineering team of NVIDIA Europe, Middle East, and Africa. Previously, he wrote his master's thesis on GPU-based pricing engines, and later continued working on the same topic. Akif has a background in computer engineering and software engineering. He's interested in parallel algorithms, GPU performance optimization, and combinatorial optimization.

**_Wearable Based Authentication_** by Deniz Ekiz

**Abstract:** The use of cloud services that process privacy-sensitive information such as digital banking, pervasive healthcare, smart home applications require an implicit continuous authentication solution which will make these systems less vulnerable to the spoofing attacks. Physiological signals can be used for continuous authentication due to their personal uniqueness. Ubiquitous wrist-worn wearable devices are equipped with photoplethysmogram sensors which enable to extract heart rate variability (HRV) features. These devices can be used for continuous physiological authentication, for enhancing the security of the cloud, edge services, and IoT devices. A system that is suitable for the smartband framework comes with new challenges such as relatively low signal quality and artifacts due to placement which were not encountered in full lead electrocardiogram systems.

**Bio:** Deniz Ekiz received the BS from Computer Engineering Department, Istanbul Bilgi University and MS degree from Computer Engineering Department, Boğaziçi University, Turkey in 2019. He is a Ph.D. candidate in the Computer Engineering Department of Boğaziçi University, Turkey. His research is focused on the applications of wearable technology. He is an active reviewer in Pattern Recognition Letters, IEEE Sensors, IEEE Affective Computing and IEEE Access.
